## How to write the script

When you open up Unity, create a C# script and name it appropriately for the Minimap. After opening the script, delete the void Start function but change the void Update function to void LateUpdate. Create a public Transform variable and name it appropriately for the camera that will be used for the showing the contents of the minimap.
